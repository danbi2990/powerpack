# ðŸŽ©âš¡ powerpack

Supercharge your [Alfred] workflows by building them in Rust ðŸ¦€!

[Alfred]: https://www.alfredapp.com

## ðŸš€ Getting started

This project contains a `powerpack` crate which provides types for developing
script filter Alfred workflows in Rust. It also provides a command line tool to
initialize, build, and install  workflows built using the `powerpack` crate.

Firstly, install the command line tool.
```sh
cargo install powerpack-cli
```

Now create a new project using a similar API as `cargo new` or `cargo init`.
```sh
powerpack new myworkflow
```

This will create a new Rust project as well as a `workflow/` directory
containing information about your Alfred workflow. The following will create
a release build of the workflow and copy it to the `workflow/` directory.
```sh
powerpack build
```

Now you can link it. The following will symlink the `workflow/` directory to
the Alfred preferences folder.
```sh
powerpack link
```

To package a `.alfredworkflow` file for release you can run the following.
```sh
powerpack package
```

## ðŸ’¡ Examples

The following projects are built using `powerpack`.
